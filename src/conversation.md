  Front-end designer?
    Yeah! It's a wonderful term Brad Frost coined [http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/] to describe a role between design and engineering, "creating the HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface".
  So designers should code?
    Absolutely. It has no doubt made me a better designer. Code is just another tool, and happens to be one of the best design tools I've found.
