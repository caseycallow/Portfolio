Developers were spending lots of time setting up Github repos and managing configuration settings rather than focusing on development. Management needed a way to check the status of the product line. Our solution was to build a dashboard that aided in easy creation/configuration of new apps and services, and allow for a high-level view of the availability of all applications.",

Developers needed a top down view, configuration options, settings, and power features. Managers would only usually need a top down view. It made sense to focus the app around the area where both user goals intersected, so I began thinking about the landing page."

          "paragraph": "The landing page needed to serve one goal: provide a high-level summary of the availability state (either available or unavailable) of a list of apps. A card based layout would provide room for a status component, title, meta data, and any action link we might need."

Part of the challenge was that the amount of options was in flux and I had very little requirements to latch onto, so the design needed to be dynamic and scalable. Tabbed navigation was the best way to do this because the tab list could easily grow as more settings were added."

Both the creation form and the detail overlay controls slide over the dashboard page without completely obscuring it where clicking outside the panel dismisses it. I struggled with several ideas before landing on this. Should the app detail go to a new page? If it doesn't, how do I create a sense of layering without making it a modal? Does it work on a phone? Eventually, I landed on this drawer-style UI which eliminated the need for any signposting “you are here” UI, and back button, or page reloading by creating a strong sense of vertical layering. I also knew our Angular developers would be able to update any page component without fully refreshing the page."

Jumping into code early and not restricting myself to a set 'whiteboard -> mockup -> code' process allowed for the flowing of creative ideas and the ability to validate design decisions quickly. I could now test how the design held up on different browser widths and devices, and start introducing animation and state to the UI."

Many assumptions had to be made in the absence of strict user needs, and I often found myself designing with data that would be out of date in a few days. This forced me to iterate more frequently and not grow attached to specific UI solutions. Sometimes the only tangible data I would have to work with was a JSON object. However, designing and coding the UI layer in parallel with API development meant I was collaborating incredibly closely with the dev team and building a deeper understanding of the system, which ultimately led to a better product."

Working close to the state government level meant having to understand multiple hierarchies, nomenclature, different data sources, and competing policies and goals from each community college."

For demos, we pulled the repository and ran it on a local server, giving us a link to share with the client to click through and interact with the prototype. Because each pattern was templated and set up with the proper class names and structure, I could easily make content changes to JSON files during meetings, which would instantly update the underlying patterns. This proved to be invaluable, as labels and dropdowns and cards were constantly changing and adapting as we worked with users."

          "paragraph": "An unexpected side effect of protoyping in the browser was that people we showed it to often thought the protoype <strong>was</strong> the final product. While we were able to get great feedback early, we also had to educate the client on the nuances of how software is built. Software doesn't follow the normal rules when it comes to visible progress -- there is much more involved that is invisible. A database schema, API design, AWS architecture all tend to go unnoticed in a demo where all eyes are trained on the UI. So from the surface, it sometimes appeared as if progress was slowing, even though it wasn't. I think this is a helpful lesson that reveals a lot about how human beings perceive software. The interface is the product, and the product is the brand. This is another reason why consistency, predictability, and ease of use are so important in UI design."
